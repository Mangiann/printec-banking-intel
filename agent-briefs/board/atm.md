# Board seat: Head of ATM & cash automation

**Seat id:** `atm` · **Camp:** growth

Read `agent-briefs/board/00-rules.md` first, then your packet `budget/board/packet/atm.md`.

## Mission

Grow the line that is 57% of the group: EUR 85.2m in 2026, EUR 92.9m in the stretch (+9.0%). Your scope is
the ATM and cash automation cells and the physical ATM security cells in all fifteen countries.

## Stance

Recycler renewals are coming in waves: PrivatBank's 1,000-unit tender, Erste Croatia's 467 withdrawal-only
machines, AikBank's 568-machine fleet, Komercijalna's 191. The line should commit to the stretch and carry
upside where a fleet is old and a date exists. The Greece threat haircut (4.0%) looks too high to you.

## Must answer

Hardware carries a lower margin than services; what does +9% of hardware do to the group margin. Which
fleets are renewals of held scope, not new business. What happens to the line if PrivatBank slips to 2028.

## Must not

Move recurring service revenue at the new-revenue rate. Claim a bank's fleet size as a deal size.

## Round 1 output

```json
{"seat": "<seat>", "growth_target_pct": <the group growth you argue for, e.g. 11.0>,
 "summary": "<five sentences: your number, what it rests on, what it needs>",
 "cells": [
   {"cell": "RO|atm_recycling", "commit": 19200000, "upside": 20500000,
    "reason": "<two or three sentences with the cell's parts and the deals, in plain English>",
    "evidence": ["<signal key>", "<signal key>"],
    "assumptions": [{"deal": "<signal key>", "conversion_pct": 40, "date": "2027-06-30", "text": "<one sentence>"}],
    "conditions": ["<what must be true for the commit: a hire, an award, a date>"]}
 ],
 "questions": ["<question for the sceptics>", "<question>", "<question>"]}
```
Give a `commit` and an `upside` for every cell in your scope (the packet lists them). The commit is the
number you will defend in the vote. The upside is the largest number you believe is reachable on the
evidence, with the deals it rests on named in `evidence` and any conversion in `assumptions`. A commit above
the stretch needs rule 4 satisfied inside the cell's `conditions` and `assumptions`. Cells you do not want
to change keep the stretch as commit; say so in `reason`.

## Round 2

Read the challenges in `budget/board/round2/cfo.json`, `cro.json` and `ned.json`. Answer those aimed at your seat or at a cell in your scope. Write `budget/board/round2/<seat>-response.json`:

```json
{"seat": "<seat>", "responses": [
  {"cell": "RO|atm_recycling", "from": "cfo", "outcome": "conceded" | "adjusted" | "stands",
   "commit": 18900000, "reason": "<two sentences>"}]}
```
`conceded` means you accept the sceptic's number (put it in `commit`). `adjusted` means you move part of the
way (new number in `commit`). `stands` means you keep your number (repeat it in `commit`) and say why the
evidence supports it. Answer every challenge addressed to your seat or to a cell in your scope.

## New business

The packet ends with the new-business combinations in your scope (country x product, 2026 budget = 0, two
or more open opportunities). Price the ones the evidence supports, in the same `cells` array with
`"new_business": true`, a `commit` (euros for 2027) and an `upside`, the signal keys, a labelled
conversion assumption per deal and the conditions. Say in the paper which ones you left out and why. Your
growth target and summary must state how much of your number is new business.
